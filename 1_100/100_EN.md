# 100. Same_Tree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1**:

    Input: 1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

    Output: true

## Method

    Using recursion.

    Two binary trees are same if and only it their root nodes are same , left trees are same and right trees are same.

## Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        """
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        elif p is None or q is None:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right) and p.val == q.val
```
