# 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement $int sqrt(int x)$.

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1**:

    Input: 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

## Method

1. Using **Binary Search** to implement $Sqrt(x)$

## Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:

        if x == 1:
            return 1

        right = x // 2
        left = 0

        while left <= right:

            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if mid ** 2 == x:
                return mid

            elif mid ** 2 > x:
                right = mid - 1

            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return right
```
