# 33. Problem Definition of Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., $[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]$ might become $[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]$).

You are given a $target$ value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return $-1$.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of $O(log n)$.

**Example 1**:

    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
    Output: 4

## Method

1. Find smallest number's index use Binary Search
2. The found index is the rotated place

## Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # find smallest index use Binary Search
        low = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            if nums[mid] > nums[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

        # low = high is the smallest number's index, also the rotated place
        rotate = low
        low = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            realmid = (rotate + mid) % len(nums) # !!!
            if nums[realmid] == target:
                return realmid
            if nums[realmid] > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1

        return -1
```
