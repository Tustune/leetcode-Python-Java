# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1**:

    Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    Output: tail connects to node index 1
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

## Method

Using HashMap

## Python Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None

        check = {}

        while head:
            check[head] = check.setdefault(head, 0) + 1
            if check[head] > 1:
                return head
            head = head.next

        return None
```
